        <p>I'm Adelso, a passionate and dedicated software development student at BYU Pathway Worldwide. Originally from
            Guatemala
            City, I've developed a unique blend of technical and interpersonal skills. My mission in Brazil Salvador was
            a
            transformative experience, allowing me to become fluent in three languages: Spanish, Portuguese, and
            English. This
            linguistic versatility has taught me how to quickly learn new concepts and effectively communicate with
            diverse teams.

            My journey into software development is driven by a desire to build practical, impactful solutions. While my
            studies and
            familyâ€”especially my sonâ€”are my main focus, I also make time for my other passions. You can often find me
            watching
            movies, listening to music, or cheering on my favorite soccer teams.

            This portfolio is a reflection of my commitment and growth as a developer. I'm excited to share my projects
            and continue
            building a career in this dynamic field.

        <p>Located in the heart of Guatemala's jungle, Tikal is one of the largest and most significant archaeological
            sites of the ancient Maya civilization. It was a major urban and ceremonial center from the 6th century B.C.
            to the 10th century A.D. The site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, celebrated for its impressive temples,
