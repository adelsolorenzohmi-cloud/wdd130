        <p>My name is Adelso, and I'm a student of software development at BYU Pathway Worldwide. Originally from
            Guatemala City, I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I served a mission in
            Brazil Salvador, which helped me become fluent in three languages: Spanish, Portuguese, and English. In my
            free time, when I'm not focused on my studies or my son, I love to watch movies, ten to music, and cheer on
            my favorite soccer teams.

        <p>Located in the heart of Guatemala's jungle, Tikal is one of the largest and most significant archaeological sites of the ancient Maya civilization. It was a major urban and ceremonial center from the 6th century B.C. to the 10th century A.D. The site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, celebrated for its impressive temples, pyramids, and palaces.</p>
