    <h1>My favorite city.</h1>
    <p> Guatemala City is the perfect starting point for exploring Guatemala's natural and cultural wonders. While the
        city
        itself is a vibrant hub with museums and markets, its greatest strength is its proximity to iconic destinations.
        From
        here, you can easily visit the ancient Mayan city of Tikal in the rainforest or the breathtaking beauty of Lake
        Atitlán,
        surrounded by volcanoes and indigenous villages.</p>

    <p>I have many wonderful memories of Guatemala. I loved visiting Xetulul, a fun theme park, and experiencing the
        serene
        beauty of Lake Atitlán. My trip to Tikal was truly magical—climbing the ancient temples and imagining the Mayan
        people's
        lives was an unforgettable experience. These adventures have made Guatemala City and the country as a whole my
        favorite
        place to visit.</p>
